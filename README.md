# Fruits - Symfony

This is a sample coding task that will demonstrate the use of Symfony and jQuery.




## Installation

After cloning the repository, open a terminal and navigate to the projects root directory. Install the following dependencies:

```bash
  composer install
```
Open .env file in the project's root directory and modify the DATABASE_URL and MAILER_DSN.

If you haven't created a blank database yet, you can create one in the terminal:
```bash
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
```
This will create a new database based on the DATABASE_URL credentials on your .env file.
